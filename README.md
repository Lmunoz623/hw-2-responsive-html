# hw-2-responsive-html
A homework demo using css and bootstrap to create a responsive portfolio.

## Project Summary
This homework demo included the use of javascrip to apply the use of buttons, navbar, sticky footer, columns and rows. Javascript also allows for the screen to reflect a certain size and layout when viewed on a desktop vs. being viewed from a mobile device.

### Result
Upon completing the demo, I have ensure the links were properly. I have also ensure the navbar remains consistent throughout each webpage and that use of columns and rows were applied. A sticky footer has also been applied and functions as intended.
